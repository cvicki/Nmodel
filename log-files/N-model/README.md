##### Log File Descriptions:

###### d1:
Description: Simplifying algo 1. 
Kept algo 1's formulas for estimating value and advantage functions. Modified code so that the Value NN was only updated once at the end(add_value called only once) compared to when called twice in original algorithm. Used algo 1's network parameters. (Following logs also used the same parameters)

Result: At around the 10-12 iteration, output showed signs of learning and improvement (judged by % of optimal actions increasing). Final iteration (50) had % of optimal actions at ~69. This is comparable to some runs of the original algorithm. 

###### d2, d2_2:
Description: Modified value fun to be the adv. fun of algo 2 and used algo 1's adv fun. Used algo 2's order of execution.
